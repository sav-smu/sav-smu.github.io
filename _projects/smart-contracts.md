title: Testing Smart Contracts

description: |
  Smart contracts are blockchain based contracts which bind multiple parties through executable programs. “Code is Law”! They are believed to revolutionize many industries. Like traditional programs, smart contracts may suffer from bugs and vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional programs, due to the nature of blockchain, smart contracts cannot be easily patched. It is thus important that smart contracts are thoroughly tested or, even better, verified.
