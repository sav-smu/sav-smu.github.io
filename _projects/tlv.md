A (Java) class provides a service to its clients (i.e., programs which use the class). The service must satisfy certain specifications. Different specifications might be expected at different levels of abstraction depending on the clientâ€™s objective. In order to effectively
contrast the class against its specifications, whether manually or automatically, one essential step is to automatically construct an abstraction of the given class at a proper level of abstraction. The abstraction should be correct (i.e., over-approximating) and accurate (i.e., with few spurious traces).

We present an automatic approach, which combines testing, learning, and validation, to constructing an abstraction. Our approach is designed such that a large part of the abstraction is generated based on testing and learning so as to minimize the use of
heavy-weight techniques like symbolic execution. The abstraction is generated through a process of abstraction/refinement, with no user input, and converges to a specific level of abstraction depending on the usage context. The generated abstraction is guaranteed to be correct and accurate. We have implemented the proposed approach in a toolkit named TLV and evaluated TLV with a number of benchmark programs as well as three real-world ones. The results show that TLV generates abstraction for program analysis and verification more efficiently.
