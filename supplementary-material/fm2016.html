<p>This page contains <strong>supplementary material</strong> for our short paper, <em>Towards Learning and Verifying Invariants of Cyber-Physical Systems by Code Mutation</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48989-6_10">DOI</a>), published at <a href="http://fm2016.cs.ucy.ac.cy/">FM 2016</a>.</p>
<h2>Mutations</h2>
<p>The negative traces used for learning were generated by the SWaT simulator running under six different mutations. The code of the SWaT simulator is not yet available online, but we summarise the six mutations and their locations below. The identifiers in brackets correspond to the filenames of the negative traces also available on this webpage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutant One (plc1f):</strong> in PLC 1, the assignment <tt>HMI.P101.Permissive[1] = HMI.MV201.Status == 2</tt> was mutated to <tt>HMI.P101.Permissive[1] = HMI.MV201.Status == 1</tt>.
<p /></li>
<li><strong>Mutant Two (plc2c):</strong> in PLC 2, the guard of an if-statement <tt>HMI.P2.State==1</tt> was mutated to <tt>HMI.P2.State==2</tt>.
<p /></li>
<li><strong>Mutant Three (plc3b):</strong> in PLC 3, an assignment <tt>HMI.MV303.Auto = 0</tt> was mutated to <tt>HMI.MV303.Auto = 1</tt>.
<p /></li>
<li><strong>Mutant Four (plc3d):</strong> in PLC 3, the guard of an if-statement <tt>HMI.P4.State == 1</tt> was mutated to <tt>HMI.P4.State == 2</tt>.
<p /></li>
<li><strong>Mutant Five (plc3e):</strong> in PLC 3, the guard of an if-statement <tt>case(1)</tt> was mutated to <tt>case(2)</tt>.
<p /></li>
<li><strong>Mutant Six (plc4a):</strong> in PLC 4, an assignment <tt>HMI.P3.State=2</tt> was mutated to <tt>HMI.P3.State=1</tt>.
<p /></li>
</ul>
<h2>SWaT Training Data</h2>
<p>The positive and negative traces of sensor data obtained from the SWaT simulator are available to download below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive Traces:</strong> <a href="./fm2016/fm2016_positive_traces.zip">here</a> (.zip)</li>
<li><strong>Negative Traces:</strong> <a href="./fm2016/fm2016_negative_traces.zip">here</a> (.zip)</li>
</ul>
<p>The traces log the water levels of the five (simulated) tanks in SWaT over 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The positive traces were obtained from the SWaT simulator without mutations. The files <tt>normalX.txt</tt> contain traces resulting from three different initial states <tt>X</tt> (i.e. different initialisations of water tank levels).</p>
<p>The negative traces were obtained from the SWaT simulator under the six mutations (each in isolation). The files <tt>&lt;ID&gt;X.txt</tt> contain traces resulting from initial state <tt>X</tt> under the mutant with identifier <tt>ID</tt>.</p>
<h2>Classifier</h2>
<p>The classifier presented in the paper only gives the coefficients to three decimal places. The full classifier we learnt is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em>-0.3492853062583663</em> v_1<br />
<em>9.78873712411496</em> v_2<br />
<em>-10.191567805729619</em> v_3<br />
<em>0.8031654936094128</em> v_4<br />
<em>-5.560554789806133</em> v_5</p>
<p><em>-0.6298698273967602</em> v_1&#8242;<br />
<em>-10.455262029320693</em> v_2&#8242;<br />
<em>10.333015684807378</em> v_3&#8242;<br />
<em>0.8031654936094128</em> v_4&#8242;<br />
<em>3.9283341201904705</em> v_5&#8242;</p>
<p><em>rho = -786.4158631412631</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The variables <em>v_1, &#8230; v_5</em> and <em>v_1&#8242;, &#8230; v_5&#8242;</em> denote the water levels of the five tanks at 250ms apart.</p>
