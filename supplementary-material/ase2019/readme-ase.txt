The programs used in our smart fuzzing experiments leverage genetic algorithms to generate test cases. These test cases will drive SWaT or WADI into an unsafe state.

=====
Setup
=====

Ensure your device is physically connected to the relevant PLC of SWaT or WADI.

Predictive models are required for the targeted sensors.

=====
Usage
=====

One example is presented in the code. Run "python example.py".
